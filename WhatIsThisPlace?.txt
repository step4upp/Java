This is personal Java practicing repository.

There might be more exercises that I have done from online courses (or sometimes practicing by myself).

I opened it for others see and get some advise how to improve my skills on Java.

You can add some Java exercises that will help me and the others, who accidentally visit this place, want to improve.
