This is personal Code practicing repository.

There might be more exercises that I have done from online courses (or sometimes practicing by myself).

I opened it for others see and get some advise how to improve my skills on any computer language.

You can add exercises that you have made or done.

It will help me and the others, who accidentally visit this place, want to improve.
